# Baseline-Correction under supervision of Dr.Daniela TÃ¤uber
This program correct baseline for spectroscopy data with 2 methods :

1.Using iterative polynomial regression then subtract them from raw spectra

2.Using assymetric least square method

First you can choose desire Path for your Raw data After run programm do as below:

1.draw raw spectra spectra
2.Then ask if you need to select desire region or not
3.Then ask which method you like to use
4.if you select subtract method you ask for degree of polynomial
5.if you select region select mode programm ask you for wavelength band
6.at the end programm save and plot corrected spectra in same folder as Path
